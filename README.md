## Stream Enrich has been moved to the [snowplow/enrich](https://github.com/snowplow/enrich) repo, where it is still actively maintained.

# Stream Enrich

## Introduction

Stream Enrich reads raw [Snowplow][snowplow] events from

-  [Amazon Kinesis][kinesis]
-  [NSQ][nsq]
-  [Kafka][kafka]
-  stdin

enriches them using [Snowplow Common Enrich][common-enrich] library and emits enriched events to an output stream.

    $ git clone git@github.com:snowplow/stream-enrich.git
